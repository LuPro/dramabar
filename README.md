# dramabar


There is a big "progressbar" style thing in the mainroom.
It currently hangs next to the lounge entrance.
Inside are 
 - 15 pcs WS2801 pixels
 - an Adafruit pro Trinket 5V that is only programmable over FTDI 
 - and 2 buttons

One can raise or lower the current moodlevel by hitting the + or - button respectively.
If it reaches 15 it turns all rainbowy and the bar goes doomsday red gloomy on -1.

It is not complicated, the code is super straight forward and was hacked together in half an hour after a beer so don't expect some wizardry in here.
