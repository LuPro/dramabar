# dramabar


There is a big "progressbar" style thing in the mainroom.
It currently hangs next to the lounge entrance.
Inside are 
 - 15 pcs WS2801 pixels
 - an Adafruit pro Trinket 5V that is only programmable over FTDI 
 - and 2 buttons

One can raise or lower the current moodlevel by hitting the + or - button respectively.
If it reaches 15 it turns all rainbowy and the bar goes doomsday red gloomy on -1.

TODO Adafruit code:
- Code clean up
- change the time logic from "previous time triggered" and "now" to "now" and "time for next trigger" because it solves some problems with counter manipulation

TODO ESP code:
- write interface for listening to the Adafruit for mood status (serial interface needs a logic level shifter, maybe an analog value would be easier to implement)
- clean up and make failsafer (currently the program crashes as soon as serial data is received
- implement password authentication (is this really required?)

TODO Website:
- Include animatable dramabar logo (which can be set to the actual color and mood values of the dramabar)
- Set up so that other values than default values can be loaded (would also need some ESP Code additions)
